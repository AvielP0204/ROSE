ideas:
1. make a seed generator that will use a random seed to spawn the obstacles. this will allow to reuse the same
road many times to playtest the car(s) in different scenarios.
2. obstacle customization. this feature will allow the players to enable / disable certain obstacles from appearing
during the run. for example: you could make only penguins spawn, only crashable obstacles and so on.
3. car customization. this feature will allow the users to change their car name and color during the game, without
the need to edit them in the code.
4. car animations. instead of the car snapping to the lane it turned to, it will slowly "slide" to that lane, which
looks nicer. could also add animations for jumping and collecting.
5. score tracker. the website will track the scores the car got each run. it will also show the difference, the
fps setting used, and will also show the average between all the runs. can be combined with idea no 1 to also display
the seed used.+
6. a feature that will show how good was your move, based on best_driveer.pyc's logic. will also add a "training"
mode that will be the player's car vs best_driver.pyc, but best_driver.pyc will be a ghost that will spawn on the
same location as the player. it will not collide with it, and will serve to show the difference between your logic
and the "best" logic.
